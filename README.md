<h1>Liri Node Application</h1>
<i>Created by Brooks Burwell</i>

>This application is based on the popular assistant Siri. The purpose is to take a users input and search for it. The user can control what sort of search the assistant searches for by the command before the input. It is an all-around useful application for most of your movie and music needs.

>To use this app, simply search with one of the following commands "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says". Following that command, input a movie title, song name, or artist name. The results for each of these will give you information about the movie or song, and if it's an event it will provide you information about the event. You can see some examples of the app working below.
