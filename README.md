<h1>Liri Node Application</h1>
<i>Created by Brooks Burwell</i>

This application is based on the popular assistant Siri. The purpose is to take a users input and search for it. The user can control what sort of search the assistant searches for by the command before the input. It is an all-around useful application for most of your movie and music needs.

To use this app, simply search with one of the following commands "spotify-this-song", "concert-this", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says". Following that command, input a movie title, song name, or artist name. You can see some examples of the app working below.
